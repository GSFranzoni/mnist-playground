# MNIST Playground

> Draw a digit. Watch it become 784 pixels. See a tiny neural network make its best guess.

MNIST Playground is a small, interactive digit-recognition experiment. Sketch a handwritten number from 0–9 and the browser preprocesses it into the same 28 × 28 pixel format used by MNIST before running inference with the included trained network.

## What it does

- Lets you draw directly on a touch-friendly canvas.
- Crops, centers, scales, and converts the sketch into 784 normalized inputs.
- Loads the trained network once as a static asset and shows its prediction and confidence.
- Includes local Bun commands to train and evaluate the model against MNIST CSV data.

## Quick start

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.4 or newer.

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

Open the Vite URL printed in the terminal, usually `http://localhost:5173`.

## Download the MNIST dataset

The web playground already includes trained weights, so downloading the dataset is only required if you want to train or evaluate the network locally.

```bash
bun scripts/download-mnist.ts
```

The script downloads the MNIST archive temporarily, extracts **only** its training and test CSV files, and removes the archive afterward:

```text
datasets/mnist/train.csv
datasets/mnist/test.csv
```

> [!NOTE]
> The download script uses the system `unzip` command. Dataset files are ignored by Git and are never included in the web build.

## Commands

| Command                         | Purpose                                            |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `bun run dev`                   | Start the web app through Turborepo.               |
| `bun run build`                 | Produce the Vite production build.                 |
| `bun run typecheck`             | Type-check every workspace package.                |
| `bun run lint`                  | Lint the workspace.                                |
| `bun run test`                  | Run neural-network and web utility tests.          |
| `bun scripts/download-mnist.ts` | Download MNIST training and test CSV files.        |
| `bun run start:training`        | Train the network from local MNIST CSV files.      |
| `bun run sync:weights`          | Publish the latest trained weights to the web app. |
| `bun run start:testing`         | Evaluate the network against the MNIST test set.   |

## Project structure

```text
apps/web                 Vite + React drawing playground
packages/neural-network  Browser-safe layers, inference, and MNIST topology
packages/training        Bun-only CSV loading, training, evaluation, and terminal UI
```

The web app loads its published weights from `apps/web/public/artifacts/weights.json`. Training writes local output to `artifacts/weights.json`; after reviewing a run, use `bun run sync:weights` to publish that artifact to the web app. Training data and local artifacts are ignored by Git; use the download command above before running training or evaluation.

## Deployment

Pushing to `main` deploys the web app to GitHub Pages through the included workflow. In the GitHub repository settings, set **Pages → Source** to **GitHub Actions** once.
